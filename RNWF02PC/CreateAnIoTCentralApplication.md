# Create an IoT Central Application for your Device

IoT Central allows you to create an application dashboard to monitor the telemetry and take appropriate actions based on customized rules.

1. Navigate to the Azure [IoT Central Build](https://aka.ms/iotcentral) site, then sign in with the Microsoft personal, work, or school account associated with your Azure subscription. If you are not currently logged into your [Microsoft account](https://account.microsoft.com/account), you will be prompted to sign in with your credentials to proceed. If you do not have an existing Microsoft account, go ahead and create one now by clicking on the `Create one!` link

2. Azure IoT Builder will guide you through the process of creating your application. Review and select the various settings for your IoT Central application (if needed, refer to [Create an application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-central/core/quick-deploy-iot-central) for additional guidance on selecting the settings for your application). Do not click the `Create` button just yet - only after reviewing and taking into consideration the following recommendations:
  
    - Choose a unique `Application name` (which will result in a unique `URL`) for accessing your application. Azure IoT Builder will populate a suggested unique `Application name` which can/should be leveraged, resulting in a unique `URL` shown on the screen. Take note of the unique/customizable portion of the `URL` (e.g. "custom-1pfphmras2b" like shown in the below screen shot) as it will be needed in a future step (suggest copy/pasting the exact text into a text editor doc file as temporary storage for the name)

    - If you select the **Free** plan, you can connect up to 5 devices for free.  However, the free trial period will expire after 7 days which means a [paid pricing plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/iot-central/) will need to be selected to continue using the application.  Of course, there is nothing to stop you from creating a new free trial application but the device will need to be configured for the app from scratch.  Since the **Standard** plans each allow 2 free devices with no time-restricted trial period, if you only plan on evaluating 1 or 2 devices for connecting to the IoT Central app, then it's best to choose the **Standard 2** plan to get the highest total allowable number of messages (30K per month)

    - `Billing info` section: If there is an issue with selecting an existing subscription in the drop-down list (or no subscriptions appear in the list at all), click on the `Create subscription` link to create a new subscription to use for the creation of this application.  Take note of the exact subscription name (e.g. "Azure subscription 1" like shown in the below screen shot) which was selected as it will be needed in a future step (suggest copying/pasting the exact text into a text editor file as temporary storage for the name)

        NOTE: If the message `Something went wrong` appears underneath the `Azure subscription` field, open up a web browser and log into your account using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) then retry selecting (or creating) a valid subscription

3. Click the `Create` button (the application will be automatically saved in your [IoT Central Portal](https://apps.azureiotcentral.com)). You can access the newly-created application (and the rest of your IoT Central applications) in the future by accessing the [link]((https://apps.azureiotcentral.com)) to the IoT Central Portal.
